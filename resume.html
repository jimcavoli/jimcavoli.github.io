					Summary
				</div>
				<div class="item">
					I am a driven and seasoned web application programmer, passionate about standards-based data-driven apps. Cloud-based computing, application scaling, inter-product, and cross-language challenges are all welcome challenges which I take pride in engineering maintainable, compatible solutions for. With experience implementing or interfacing with most all the available industry-standard solutions, I am competent, confident, and excited about diving in to new environments with complex requirements. I have worked with start-ups and been worked in multiple enterprise-class environments as well, and seek to distill the best attributes of both in the process and products of my work.
